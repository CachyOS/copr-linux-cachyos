# **CachyOS Settings**

Settings used in CachyOS, including modprobe configurations and udev rules, specifically packaged and optimized for Fedora.
* [GitHub CachyOS-Settings](https://github.com/CachyOS/CachyOS-Settings).

# **scx-scheds and scx-tools**

The `scx-scheds` package provides Various sched-ext (BPF) schedulers. `scx-tools` includes `scxctl` for managing and monitoring these schedulers.
* [GitHub scx-scheds](https://github.com/sched-ext/scx).

# **scx-manager**

A simple and intuitive GUI for managing and switching between different sched-ext schedulers via scx_loader.
* [GitHub scx-manager](https://github.com/CachyOS/scx-manager/).

# **Ananicy-cpp**

An auto-nice daemon with CachyOS-specific rules to improve system responsiveness by automatically adjusting process priorities. Note: It is usually okay to use alongside sched-ext, but can be disabled as a troubleshooting step if instability occurs.
